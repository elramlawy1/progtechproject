✅ Design patterns demonstrated (5 points)

Total: 60 points possible


🎯 QUICK START OPTIONS:
-----------------------

Option 1 - Using IDE (EASIEST):
1. Open project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
2. IDE will auto-detect Maven and download dependencies
3. Right-click Main.java → Run
4. Right-click test files → Run Tests

Option 2 - Using Maven Command Line:
1. Install Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Run: mvn clean compile
3. Run: mvn test (to run all tests)
4. Run: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gomoku.Main"

Option 3 - Using provided scripts:
1. Double-click setup.bat (will check/install dependencies)
2. Double-click run.bat (to start the game)


📋 DESIGN PATTERNS (Be ready to explain!):
------------------------------------------

1. STRATEGY PATTERN (ai package):
   - Interface: AIStrategy
   - Implementation: RandomAIStrategy
   - Client: AIPlayer
   - Purpose: Easy to add new AI strategies without changing code

2. SINGLETON PATTERN (DatabaseManager):
   - Only ONE database connection for entire app
   - Thread-safe getInstance() method
   - Purpose: Resource management, avoid connection conflicts

3. FACADE PATTERN (Game class):
   - Simplifies complex board operations
   - One method (makeMove) handles validation, updates, win checking
   - Purpose: Hide complexity from UI layer


🧪 TESTING COVERAGE:
-------------------
✅ BoardTest: 15 tests (win detection, validation, edge cases)
✅ GameTest: 11 tests (game flow, turns, win/draw conditions)
✅ RandomAIStrategyTest: 7 tests (AI behavior, strategy pattern)
✅ GameRepositoryTest: 8 tests (database save/load operations)

Total: 41+ unit tests covering all business logic!


💾 DATABASE SCHEMA:
------------------
Table: saved_games
- id, game_name, rows, columns, current_player, move_count, save_date

Table: board_cells
- id, game_id, row_index, col_index, cell_state

Demonstrates: Primary keys, foreign keys, relationships, transactions


📚 JAVADOC DOCUMENTATION:
------------------------
Every class and method has complete JavaDoc comments including:
- @author tags
- @version tags
- @param descriptions
- @return descriptions
- Purpose and usage explanation

Generate HTML docs: mvn javadoc:javadoc


🎮 GAME FEATURES:
----------------
✅ 15x15 board (customizable size)
✅ 2-player game (Human vs AI)
✅ Random AI opponent
✅ Board editor (set custom positions)
✅ Save/Load games to database
✅ Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, anti-diagonal)
✅ Draw detection (board full)
✅ Move validation
✅ Complete logging to file


🔍 FOR DEFENSE - KEY EXPLANATIONS:
---------------------------------

Q: "Explain your OO design"
A: The project uses layered architecture:
   - Model layer (Board, Game, Move, CellState)
   - AI layer (strategy pattern for extensibility)
   - Database layer (singleton pattern for resource management)
   - UI layer (CommandLineInterface)
   Each class has single responsibility, methods are well-encapsulated.

Q: "How does win detection work?"
A: After each move, Board.checkWinner() examines the position in 4 directions
   (horizontal, vertical, two diagonals). For each direction, it counts
   consecutive pieces. If 5 or more consecutive pieces found, player wins.
   The algorithm is in checkDirection() method - very straightforward!

Q: "Why did you choose these design patterns?"
A: 
   - Strategy: Makes AI extensible (can easily add SmartAI, DefensiveAI)
   - Singleton: DatabaseManager needs exactly one instance to manage connections
   - Facade: Game class hides board complexity from UI, easier to use

Q: "Show me the tests work"
A: Run: mvn test
   All 41+ tests should pass, showing:
   - Move validation works
   - Win detection works in all directions
   - AI makes valid moves
   - Database save/load works correctly

Q: "Demonstrate the database"
A: 
   1. Start game, make some moves
   2. Save game with a name
   3. Exit and restart
   4. Load saved game - board state is restored!
   5. Show actual .db file in project folder
   6. Can even connect with H2 console to see SQL tables


📝 FILES YOU SHOULD KNOW:
-------------------------
Main.java - Entry point, starts CLI
Board.java - Core game logic (290 lines) - MOST IMPORTANT
Game.java - Game flow management
CommandLineInterface.java - User interaction
DatabaseManager.java - Singleton database connection
GameRepository.java - Save/load operations
AIStrategy.java + RandomAIStrategy.java - Strategy pattern
All test files - Demonstrate testing


⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
----------------------------
❌ Don't say "I don't know how this works"
✅ If unsure, say "Let me trace through the code" and walk through it

❌ Don't just describe what code does
✅ Explain WHY you designed it that way

❌ Don't ignore the tests
✅ Tests prove your code works - reference them!


🎉 CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS:
----------------------
- The code is well-structured and commented
- Every class has a clear purpose
- All requirements are met
- Tests prove correctness
- Design patterns are properly implemented
- You can run and demonstrate it working


📞 IF ASKED TO MODIFY:
---------------------
Easy changes you can make confidently:
1. Add new board size option (just change constructor calls)
2. Add new menu option (add case in switch statement)
3. Show how to add new AI strategy (implement AIStrategy interface)
4. Add new test case (follow existing test pattern)


Good luck! You've got this! 💪

Remember: 
- Stay calm
- Walk through code systematically  
- Reference the design patterns
- Show the tests passing
- Demonstrate it working

The code is good, well-documented, and complete. Just understand what's
there and you'll do great!
